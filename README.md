Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Data science not only helps make better business decisions, but also brings interesting lessons about many aspects of life. Traveling is one of the essential leisure activities that requires us a lot of planning effort. In order to reduce the stress and anxiety involved in the process of designing a perfect travel experience, this project wants to offer findings and suggestions for your next Airbnb stay in Boston.
