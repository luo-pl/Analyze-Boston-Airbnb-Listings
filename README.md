Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
------------
Data science not only helps make better business decisions, but also brings interesting lessons about many aspects of life. Traveling is one of the essential leisure activities that requires us a lot of planning effort. In order to reduce the stress and anxiety involved in the process of designing a perfect travel experience, this project wants to offer findings and suggestions for your next Airbnb stay in Boston.

* The original datasets are available here for your quick download. You can also get access to my notebook Boston Airbnb.ipynb to review the actual code. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions in the introduction. Markdown cells will assist in walking through the thought process for each step.
